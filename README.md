# AI Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gesture Recognition
## Why do we use the virtual mouse?
The proposed AI virtual mouse system can be used to overcome problems in the real world such as situations where there is no space to use a physical mouse and also for persons who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse. Also, amidst the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of the spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to overcome these problems since hand gestures and hand Tip detection is used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera.
## Algorithm Used for Hand Tracking
For the purpose of detecting hand gestures and hand tracking, the MediaPipe framework is used, and the OpenCV library is used for computer vision. The algorithm makes use of machine learning concepts to track and recognize hand gestures and hand tips.
